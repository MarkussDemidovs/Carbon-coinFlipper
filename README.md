# A Carbon coin flipper
A Carbon coin flipper is a Coin flipper built on Google's experimental programming language called "Carbon".

## What is carbon?
Carbon is an experimental programming language designed for interoperability with C++. The project is open-source and was started at Google. Google engineer Chandler Carruth first introduced Carbon at the CppNorth conference in Toronto in July 2022. He stated that Carbon was created to be a C++ successor. The language is expected to have an experimental MVP version 0.1 in 2025 and a production-ready version 1.0 after 2027.

The language intends to fix several perceived shortcomings of C++ but otherwise provides a similar feature set. The main goals of the language are readability and "bi-directional interoperability" (which allows the user to include C++ code in the Carbon file), as opposed to using a new language like Rust, that, while being influenced by C++, is not two-way compatible with C++ programs. Changes to the language will be decided by the Carbon leads.

Carbon's documents, design, implementation, and related tools are hosted on GitHub under the Apache-2.0 license with LLVM Exceptions.

## Why did i create this?
I am currently on a challange where i have to create a project in all of the programming languages i have heard of. This is my first challange entry. 

## How to run?
To run it, you'll have to install carbon either <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/carbon-programming-language-tutorial-6d67b4cc16ae">locally</a>, or run it through the <a href="https://carbon.compiler-explorer.com/">Compiler Explorer</a> by copying and pasting the source code's text.
